    <h4>About</h4>

    <p class="lead">What is TweetFreq?</p>
    <p>TweetFreq provides tweet frequency and word counts for tweets posted by public Twitter accounts.</p>

    <p class="lead">What can I do with it?</p>
    <p>Data from TweetFreq can be used to discover patterns of activity for a given Twitter account. Patterns can be used to determine interests, connections, and biases. For example, news-related accounts tend to tweet at a higher rate during major events, but each news service will give a different amount of coverage to the same event. It is also easy to see how a brand responds to its customers.</p>

    <p>The results are downloadable in various formats. Chart data can be exported to PNG, JPEG, PDF, SVG, and printer friendly formats. All report data is available in JSON form.</p>

    <p class="lead">Why was it created?</p>
    <p>TweetFreq was created as a way of improving my understanding of modern web applications. I wanted to build something that interacted with a popular web service, and generated interesting information. The decision to use word counts was inspired by an episode of Futurama.</p>

   <p>Hopefully, TweetFreq will also serve as a reminder of what conclusions can be drawn from public sources on the internet. This site was built in less than a month, in my spare time. Marketers, advertisers, and states have access to much more sophisticated analytics.</p>

   <p class="lead">How does it work?</p>
    <p>The results are generated by analyzing up to about the last 3,200 tweets from a given Twitter account. The tweets are retrieved using <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1" target="_blank">Twitter's Application Programming Interface (API).</a></p>

    <p>After the tweets are received, TweetFreq counts how frequently words are used in all of those tweets, while ignoring extremely common and uninteresting words called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words" target="_blank">stop words.</a></p>

    <p>The number of tweets per day are calculated by counting each time a particular date was used in a timestamp of a tweet. As a result, this does not include deleted tweets, or dates when tweets were not posted.</p>

    <p>The results of each query are cached for an hour. This is done to improve responsiveness for popular queries, and to reduce the load on the site and Twitter. Those wishing to save a particular set of results should use one of the various export options described above.</p>

    <p>The source code for this project is available on <a href="https://github.com/seanthegeek/tweetfreq" target="blank_">GitHub</a>.</p>
